BISmark is the Broadband Internet Service BenchMARK. It is a project led by
Georgia Tech and the University of Napoli Federico II to develop an
OpenWRT-based platform for performing measurements of ISP performance, as well
as traffic inside the home. You can use BISmark to measure the performance of
their ISP, visualize and monitor traffic patterns from your users and devices
inside your home network, and manage your usage caps.

BISmark is a customized distribution of OpenWRT. The standard base build has a
host of useful networking tools, including iperf, netperf, traceroute,
paris-traceroute, tcptraceroute, ping, fping, bing and ditg.
