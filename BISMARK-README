Release: Quirm
Status: Release Candidate 3

Differences from Klatch:
Quirm is substantially different from Klatch. Klatch was based on OpenWRT 
trunk circa September 2011, while Quirm is based on Backfire 10.03.1. The
reasons for going back were mostly stability and the perceived need for a
good checkpoint. Many packages are affected; most notably, the Linux kernel
for Klatch is 2.6.37 while Quirm is 2.6.32. Other packages like OpenSSL have
also moved back, this may cause unexpected behavior for packages that depend
on them (for eg; the certification hashing algorithm for OpenSSL is different).
Please keep this in mind while porting Klatch packages to Quirm. The full
list of packages and versions may be obtained from the build or from the 
OpenWRT page.

BISmark:
There has been much development of the BISmark suite since Klatch. Package
development, deployment, and maintenance have been made substantially easier with the 
bismark-experiments-manager and the bismark-updater tools. Packages can be deployed
and updated on a per-router basis. The bismark-ucap package allows 
more control over how users use the network. There is also a standard
data uploader bismark-data-uploader. No significant changes have been made to 
bismark-mgmt, but bismark-active will now reside solely in ramfs. The standard
base build has a host of useful networking tools such as iperf, netperf, traceroute,
paris-traceroute, tcptraceroute, ping, fping, bing, ditg, etc.
