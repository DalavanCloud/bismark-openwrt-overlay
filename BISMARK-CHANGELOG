Release: Quirm
Status: Release Candidate 4

Changes:
- Based on OpenWRT Backfire 10.03.1. This is actually an older version of
  OpenWRT than used for Klatch. The reasons for reverting were stability and the
  perceived need for a good checkpoint. Many packages are affected; most
  notably, the Linux kernel for Klatch is 2.6.37 while Quirm is 2.6.32. Other
  packages like OpenSSL have also moved back, which may cause unexpected
  behavior for packages that depend on them (e.g., the certification hashing
  algorithm for OpenSSL is different).  Keep this in mind while porting Klatch
  packages to Quirm. The full list of packages and versions may be obtained from
  the build or from the OpenWRT page.
- New package: bismark-updater automatically updates software on routers. It is
  capable of doing per-router updates.
- New package: bismark-experiments-manager and
  luci-app-bismark-experiments-manager automatically download lists of
  "experiments", which are collections
  of packages. The user can opt in to experiments using a LuCI panel.
- New package: bismark-data-uploader transfers measurement logs to the server.
- bismark-active is now bismark-active-tmpfs, and resides in RAM.
  A fresh copy is downloaded every time the router restarts.
- The default build is compatible with uCap, a software suite for letting
  users monitor and control traffic on their home network. After undergoing
  informed consent, users can enable uCap using LuCI.
